## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly.
## The following functions create a special matrix object, compute the inverse,
## and cache the result of that computation. If the inverse has already been
## computed for a matrix, the cached inverse is returned instead of being recomputed.

## Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inv <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inv <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() inv
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cachesolve will retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    inv <- x$getinverse()
    
    ## return cached inverse if it exists
    if(!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
    }
    
    ## compute the inverse if it is not cached
    data <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinv(inv)
    inv
}
